A layered caching system built with the decorator pattern. Supports combining memory, file, local, and remote caches to improve hit rates and simplify cache logic.

---

This is a multi-layer caching system I built myself, mainly to flexibly combine different cache layers (like memory, Redis, and file) in my projects.

The project requirements were quite diverse, and the caching tools provided by frameworks were either too limited or lacked transparency. So, I decided to build my own solution‚Äîsomething tailored to my own needs.
If you happen to have similar requirements, I hope this package proves useful to you üôå.

## Features

- Supports multi-layer cache combinations with a nested cache structure, becoming more stable as it goes deeper.
- Based on the decorator pattern, extending new types of caches is very easy.
- Memory cache supports hit rate statistics, making it easier to observe and optimize.
- File cache supports concurrent locks, making it suitable for data caching in CLI scenarios.
- Custom data source interface‚Äîjust implement `Interfaces\DataSourceInterface` to integrate any data source.


## Installation

Install via Composer:

```bash
composer require hejunjie/cache
```

## Quick Start

**Note**: For ease of extension, the code only implements the cache layer (memory/redis/file). In actual use cases, it is recommended to complete the data layer yourself. The example code is shown below.

```php
<?php
use Hejunjie\Cache;

// Create a cache structure: Memory -> Redis -> File -> Database
$cache = new Cache\MemoryCache(
    new Cache\RedisCache(
        new Cache\FileCache(
            new MyDataSource(), // A data source that implements the DataSourceInterface.
            '[File] Cache folder path',
            '[File] Cache duration (seconds)'
        ),
        '[Redis] Configuration'
        '[Redis] Prefix'
        '[Redis] Persistent connection'
    ),
    '[Memory] Cache duration (seconds)',
    '[Memory] Cache quantity (to prevent memory overflow)'
);

$data = $cache->get('user:123'); // Automatically performs a layer-by-layer lookup, with cache misses propagating down to the underlying data source.
```

## Custom Data Sources

As long as you implement the following interface, it can be used as the "final data source" for the cache:

For example, you can connect to a database, an API, or even another caching system.

```php
<?php

// Custom Data Sources - database
class MyDataSource implements \Hejunjie\Tools\Cache\Interfaces\DataSourceInterface
{
    protected DataSourceInterface $wrapped;
    
    // Constructor, no need for a constructor if it's the last layer.
    // public function __construct(
    //     DataSourceInterface $wrapped
    // ) {
    //     $this->wrapped = $wrapped;
    // }

    public function get(string $key): ?string
    {
        // Get the corresponding content from the database based on the key.
        // Return the content as a string string.

        // If the next layer returns data, store it in the current layer. If it's the last layer, the following code is not needed.
        // $content = $this->wrapped->get($key);
        // if ($content !== null) {
        //     $this->set($key, $content);
        // }
        // return $content;

    }

    public function set(string $key, string $value): bool
    {
        // Store the value in the database based on the key.
        // Return the storage result as `bool`.
    }

    public function del(string $key, string $value): void
    {
        // Perform a delete operation based on the key.
        // No need to return any value.
    }
}

```

## Purpose & Motivation

This package was originally built for a few of my own side projects, so I didn‚Äôt focus too much on making it universally applicable at first. But as I kept improving it, things got smoother, so I decided to organize it and share it.

If you happen to need multi-layer caching, or you're interested in the decorator pattern, feel free to give it a try.

If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to open an issue or submit a PR ‚Äî I‚Äôll do my best to respond.
